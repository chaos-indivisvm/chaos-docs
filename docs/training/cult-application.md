# Requirements

- Make sure you read this application in its entirety. That means read every single fucking line, everything in this application is here for a reason, scrub.
So to recap:
Q: how much of this application do you have to read? A:

- We DO NOT accept bronies or furries. As of October 16th, 2019, however, we have changed our policy on accepting ex-furries. Please see below for details and a questionnaire

- An avatar age of at least 30 Days, and an RL age of at least 18 years old.

- Recruit must be fluent in the English language and be able to speak and type WITHOUT translators!

- Thick skin and a resilience to trolling/a good sense of humor is a huge plus. We are not nice. especially not to cultists.

- Don't bring any bullshit drama into our group. leave that shitty baby yiffy bullshit in the garbage where you came from. We are also not a fucking dating group so fuck off with that dorito fedora shit you dweeb trash pile.

- If accepted, you must leave all other SLMC groups, Veteran groups, however, are allowed. i.e.: Any equivalent to our Militia or a defender group is OK.

- We use Discord and Mumble to communicate during raids. You are expected to have a microphone of some sort and participate in comms during raids. You MUST have a microphone AND USE IT while in cult phase or you will not be accepted into the main group. Unrelated: The answer to the bonus question below is YELLOW!

- Knowledge of script time & rendering cost, & the willingness to adjust your avatar to lower your script number & time to promote sim health.

- Knowledge of Warhammer shit is not required but helps and means Sam can have friends. Speaking of which answer this question quick:
Q: Blood for the.. A:

- If accepted, you will go through Cult Training FIRST before being accepted into the main group. It will be YOUR responsibility to seek out trainers, and get your training done. It is also required that you are active, and participate with the group during raids, meetings, or general shenanigans. If you are unable or unwilling to meet our activity requirements you will be ejected.

## FURRY QUESTIONNAIRE

As of October 16th, 2019, we have changed our policy on accepting EX-FURRIES (not those who are STILL furries) into our group. Please answer the questions below honestly and be as detailed as possible. You will go through a rigorous background check, will have an interview with Zalera, or another member of command/Enforcer staff, and you MAY have to go through a trial period in our Militia group anywhere between 30-90 days BEFORE your application is accepted and you're allowed to begin your cult training.

If you are approved, and at any later time additional-past or new furry-involvement proof is discovered, you MAY still be ejected or have your application denied depending on the severity of the new information so it is VERY important to be honest and not leave anything out here.

Do not lie to us. If you feel you have something to hide, either be honest here or don't bother applying. We'd prefer you in militia hanging out, we're not going to tolerate you in militia if you try to outsmart us here.

Know that any and all decisions regarding approval of new applicants with past furry-involvement will be made by command and/or enforcer staff ONLY.
No exceptions.

1. Are a furry currently:
    YES/NO

2. Have you EVER been a furry in any regard in the past?
