Corruptor Training guide v6.6

## Prenote

Use this as a guide when training cultists! If you have any questions or whatever make sure you IM Zalera for clarification.

Make sure you are logging the cultist's training progress on their own tracker within the forums here: https://forum.chaos.church/viewforum.php?f=25

Keep your trackers updated: add notes and comments as needed. When they're done make sure everything is checked off and update the subject line to read "COMPLETE". 
Or if they quit or are ejected or whatever make sure that is notated in the subject line as well.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Rules

1. Make sure you are logging EVERYTHING on their tracker and that you are doing so CONSISTENTLY. I shouldn't have to guess when I look up to see what a cultist has left to do in their training.

2. No skipping phases unless given permission by Command.

3. Cultists MUST have on all parts of the cult uniform and ONLY the cult uniform. That means no extra shit like hair or edgy crap. They are basically garbage clones and must all look the same. AND NO AO's

4. Corruptors are NOT ALLOWED to train friends/acquaintances.

5. Cultists must complete ALL training requirements before being enlisted into the main group.
5a. However, If a cultist is coming in from another SLMC group or is already familiar with combat or our gear we MAY allow them to skip certain phases.

6. Don't punish cultists for finding creative ways to do things. If you tell them to get from point A to point B and they do it in a way you weren't expecting or didn't specifically instruct them to - don't punish them.

7. Remember that you are supposed to treat the cultists like the garbage that they are but you are also there to train them and teach them how the group works. If they don't know how to do something once they're in the main group and they fuck up/get in trouble it falls back on you, not them.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Indoctrination

Make sure they are aware of the nature of Chaos and the SLMC (We are a military, we have order in the group, pecking order, of sorts, we shoot things, etc.)

Let them know they are the lowliest of low among the rank of Chaos, and will be expected to be treated as such until they pass cult phase. If they cannot deal with minor annoyances among the group, tell them to eat ass. If they give you trouble, won't listen to you, or are just being little shits send them to Zalera.

Make sure they have prejump turned ON

Make sure they're using WSAD to move and E to jump. If they're new to SLMC they might have to turn on “pressing letter keys affect movement” in preferences

Make sure they are aware that we have zero tolerance for cheating (like wire framing, using movement enhancers, spacebarring, etc) and if we find out they're doing it they will be punished

Teach them how to turn off teleport screens to avoid getting blackscreened. Have them use the following preferences setup: http://i.imgur.com/Ui1l4uK.png

Make sure they are aware that getting their training done is THEIR RESPONSIBILITY! We shouldn't be constantly nagging them to get their training done. 
It's ultimately up to THEM to come to the sim/get in discord and bother whoever is online to ask to work on their training. 
If it's been a few days since you've heard from them, however, it's fine to IM them and ask them what's up.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Training


### Phase 1, Orientation

1. Cultist is to be shown to home point

2. Cultist is to set home in said home point. Make sure they have been invited to the cult group and land barrons group. Make sure they have their cult group active while on sim and doing raids

3. Cultist must go on a duck hunt for the cult box that randomly teleports around the sim. They CANNOT pester us for locations. Fuck around with them, make the box teleport around by clicking it. Make their lives as hard as possible.
- make sure they have the cult group as their active group
- also make sure they know that they have to be within 5 meters of the box when they click it or it will teleport away. Or don't tell them, whatever, it's funny.

-- After cultist finds gear --

4. Cultist will be told to read the Chaos Handbook carefully for the phase 2 test. They CAN use it for the phase 2 test but you don't have to tell them that ;^)

5. Cultist is to be given Discord information. It is your responsibility to make sure they get online and get their cultist role in the Discord. Cultists will NOT be invited into the main group until we hear them speak at least once

6. Have them add Chaos members as friends or risk getting shot in the back. Yes they have to! I don't care if they use contact sets we're all eachothers' friends so we can see who's online when we're raiding/defending

7. Show them their given weapons (Autopistol, brazier and cultist bomb). They are only allowed to use these three things in any raid as cultists.

8. [Optional] You can give the cultist a tour of the base, building platforms ETC or send them to do so themselves. Make sure you show them where not to go past during defenses. (It is Self - Explanatory but since we've had non-SLMC people join they may not know.)

### Phase 2, Examination and Courses

-- Exam --
1. Cultist is to be given Phase 2 exam. They get 30 minutes and must complete at least 8/10 of the answers correctly. Ask them their questions over mic (or in local chat if they don't have a working mic yet but remember they aren't getting into the main group until we hear their voice at least once). Be mean to them when they get questions wrong. You don't have to record everything just make sure they get 8/10

2. Upon failure, Cultists can retry but they have to read the handbook again first (give them like an hour)

-- Courses --

3. Teach the cultists the ways of SL combat movement (Mostly prim jumping). Have them go through all 3 cultist courses (m1 and shoot house) in the VR room. 
The courses aren't so much about learning to prim jump as they are about seeing how patient they are, and how willing they are to complete a task given to them/how well they can follow orders. 
If they show determination and make a good effort toward completing the courses and it's been like 5 fucking days go ahead and pass them. 
If the cultist is coming in from another SLMC group, or already has experience prim jumping we MAY have them skip this portion on approval of Command.

4. Upon passing the exam AND completing the courses (if applicable), cultists are then told they are now on phase 3



### Phase 3, Combat/Task Phase

1. Cutlist must attend at least 1 raid or defense.
Preferred at least one of each (so 2 total) but whatever

2. Cutlist must take part in a skirmish In a 10 minute time skirmish. Have them fight another cultist or an enlisted personnel. Cockfighting arena available in the VR room.

3. Throughout training, Cutlist must complete at least one unique task as set by their Corruptor. BE CREATIVE. You can randomize the same tasks over multiple cutlists.
Examples are:
- Get 20 unique kills using the cultist bomb.
- Get 5 unique kills on military leaders.
- Cultist bomb the first person they see in the first damage-enabled sim they get through the stargate.
- Survive through the entire episode of Lost Farts and Lost Farts 2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Cult Graduation
Upon completion the cultist is now ready to be promoted to Renegade. They shall then proceed to STD training. There are a few things that need to be completed before they should begin contracting their STDs

1) Make sure everything in their cult tracker is marked off/completed completely, and the subject title states "COMPLETED".
2) Make sure they get added to the main group in SL as a Renegade, and are removed from the cult group.
3) Update Discord tags: Remove cult tag, add Renegade tag
4) Have their role in the database updated to RENEGADE. This can be done by anyone in command.
5) OPTIONAL: Have someone update their role in the forums. This can be done by Zalera, Dread, Tyro, or Hadet. This is super low priority as hardly anyone besides corruptors uses forums anymore.
   
The culty is now free to move onto their STD training. hoorayva
