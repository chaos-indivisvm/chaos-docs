# The Application

Hello! This is the Chaos Indivisvm POCKET APPLICATION. If you choose to fill this form out, 
you will be interviewed before you are considered to join Chaos Indivisvm's cult.

Your interview will be conducted via SL IMs and your responses added to our own records.
Expect to spend ~20 minutes interviewing, but the total amount of time will mostly depend on you.

Furries/bronies need not apply and are encouraged to join open-enrollment militia. 
Ex-furries or those unsure are encouraged to proceed, but are not guaranteed entry. Especially if they are dishonest in the interview.
