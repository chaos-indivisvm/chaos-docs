### Introduction
This Document is to be used as reference material for all members of the Chaos Indivisvm forces, a Warhammer 40K themed Second Life military group. Within this document you will find:
- topics on history
- lore
- guidelines for behavior within the group
- expectations
- duties you are expected to perform whilst in the ranks of Chaos Indivisvm.


### Our History

Chaos traces its roots prior to 2010, created as a mockery of the Ordo Imperialis, an “Imperial” themed group rife with furry drama and sexual fraternization. We were created to be antithetical to their themes, ideals, and controversies; in short, Chaos was created to make fun of the furry groups.

At some point, the original leader of Chaos, Dark Svenska, got a taste for running an actual group beyond just trolling furries, which led to the formation of Chaos Decretum as a fully fledged combat group.

During this period blockade alliances, namely the Iron Symphony and the Anvil Coalition, started to be formed resulting in constant drama surrounding other combat groups, leading to a period of people taking this video game way too seriously. With gear leaking and real life information leaking being used against people they didn’t like, this led to a massive drop in SLMC activity.

Eventually, even Chaos Decretum fell into the unhealthy habit of these other groups; letting internal drama run rampant until it closed, which led to the same issues in each further iteration of Chaos - Hereticus, Eternus, etc.

Around 2013, with the closure of Chaos Eternus, retheme, and then merging with Coercion Combine; Chaos Indivism was formed resulting from a blanket ban of several members at Coercion. You can thank Ginga Deed.

We were told we would not last a week, but here we are.


### Our Goal

Our main goal is to have fun, whether it be through shooting prims, upsetting people who treat second life as their first life, or playing other games with members of the group.Our primary drive is engaging in combat, We like to shoot prims, the end.


### Expected Behavior

#### Your Doodie
As a member of Chaos Indivisvm, your job is to combat the furry menace and shoot the prims! And shoot through them too.

#### Activity
You are expected upon joining, to take part in raids and/or defenses regularly, as time permits. Activity is a very important aspect of your time in Chaos, affecting your eligibility for promotions, merits, and general standing within the group.
 
With this being said, we do understand that real life takes priority. If you have to take a break due to an unforeseen situation, let us know! Long periods of absence will be put into consideration. Established members of Chaos Indivisvm will be given the benefit of the doubt if they are not online for long periods of time.
 
Cultists that are absent for long periods of time without notice will be considered for removal from the Cult Group. Cultists who need to take a leave of absence due to real life or personal reasons should notify their corruptor or an officer of the group. Depending on the circumstances they may be removed from the cult group as a result, however, they are welcome back, and will be allowed to continue their training when they are able but may have to start from scratch depending on the length of the absence.


#### Common Activity

▸ Combat
Chaos Indivisvm is a COMBAT GROUP, and as such we practice it frequently. Failure to participate when you could be assisting in the raid is lame-o.
During combat operations, notify the officer in command if you need to log off or go AFK so that we can find someone to cover for you. 


▸ Recruitment
Chaos Indivisvm is always open to receiving new members. If you have any friends that are interested in the SLMC, direct them our way. Applications are available in the teleport Hub, or via almost any member of Chaos. Recruiters are eligible for a 2000 corruption payout for new members upon their completion of cult.
 
During Recruitment Ops, a mobile application dispenser will most likely be utilized in the form of a banner.


#### Uniform Standards
- You may customize your armor via tinting, but keep it classy, ladies.
- You may add decorations to your armor as long as they fit the 'Chaos' Theme.
- No form of furfaggotry including Nekos, Bronies, or Japanese weeaboos.
 
Your Uniform is to be worn at all times whilst on duty. Furry avatars are NEVER allowed while participating in Chaos shenanigans. 
 	
If you think your modification is extreme enough to warrant a second opinion, you must ask an Overlord for approval. Overlords have the final say on whether or not your uniform is appropriate. 


#### Unlocking Gear
Throughout your enlistment in Chaos, you will likely utilize different pieces of our armory. The higher the rank of the weapon, the higher the complexity, power, or utility.
 
▸ Gear in the armory may be unlocked in several ways
- Promotions
- Donation of 5k towards the sim tier, For a piece of gear of your choice. (Excluding god favor items)
- Corruption unlocks (Corruption is earned over time in sim or while raiding, or through melee weapon kills, and can be used to unlock and upgrade some items)


### Unacceptable Behavior

We're a fun bunch. Our mentality towards rule breaking is: if it is anything that can be reversed easily or fixed quickly it can be forgiven as if it never happened. That said, there are some things we won't tolerate.
 
▸ Sim Crashing 
- Intentionally crashing someone's sim isn't acceptable. Crashing sims rolls them back a few hours. If you do this, you can expect a warning and told not to do it again, followed by demotion or ejection depending on the severity.
 
▸ Graphics Crashing 
- Zero tolerance. If you graphics crash anyone, you are out.
 
▸ Doxxing 
- Doxxing is revealing/sharing private or real life information about someone. Doxxing is not finding their furaffinity account. It's not OK to initiate autistic dox wars, don't do it. You will be ejected.
 
▸ Leaking Equipment 
- Leaking someone else's hard work isn't cool. If you are handed something with full perms, check with them before you distribute it. It's not your fault if it is given to you, but it is your fault to give it out again if it's privately distributed or sold. If it's the equipment of an opposing group that you don't like very much, that doesn't make giving it out okay by any means. This also extends to copybotting. If you don't have permission to do it, don't do it.
--Ripping textures is also not OK. If you own a modifiable object and want to mess with the cosmetics, ask the creator for the texture or permission to rip it if they have trouble finding it. Generally they will give it to you.
 
▸ Causing Internal Issues
- Don't deliberately cause internal issues. If someone, especially of rank, asks you to stop doing something, stop doing it. Things will be smoother for everyone if you don't go out of your way to cause internal group drama and are open to cutting it out when called out on it.

▸ Drama
- Drama will without a doubt exist in any community. Drama destroys the morale of the group, If you go out of your way to cause it you will be dealt with swiftly. If someone is going out of their way to cause problems, contact an Enforcer.
 
▸ Cheesing internal systems 
- Don't do this. We have systems in place to allow for corruption and god favor unlocks, which are meant to take time to get. If you find a loophole and abuse the hell out of it, you're stepping all over those who are earning corruption as intended, and cheapening the experience for all of us. These goalposts are there to encourage activity and to give you something to work towards. If you find a bug, report it. Bug reports will never result in punishment.
 
▸ Lying to Us
- If you do something listed above, or something otherwise distasteful, do not lie about it. Any consequences given will be worse if you lie and may be mitigated if you are upfront and honest. We're smarter than you. We will find out eventually. All of us in this group has done something shitty or cringy on the internet, the difference is we don't lie about the shitty things we've done.


▸ Punishment
Violating our handbook standards or sim rules may result in:

- Extremely tedious tasks
- Suspension from Chaos
- Demotion
- Sent to cultist trials and rank
- Ejection from group
- Etc. Insert horrible thing here

Special Treatment between ranks is NOT permitted within Chaos. If someone is "punished" in an exceptionally light manner in comparison to other offenders of the same offense, notify an Enforcer & they will pass the information to the correct parties.


#### Furry Policy
Chaos hates furries. Chaos hates Bronies. Chaos hates anime weeaboo trash. If you take this part too seriously, you are the problem. These “people” were previously not allowed in Chaos under any circumstances, however we have relaxed this rule in recent years. Furries, Bronies, and Weebs were previously not allowed because they brought in constant internet relationship drama. If you want to bring any of that with you, you are not welcome here. If someone cannot separate themself from jerking off to their pink fox bat OC long enough to do combat or interact with others, they are the type of person this rule was put in place for.
 
▸Furries and Bronies 
Furries are now allowed in Chaos under certain circumstances and only after time spent in the Militia group is completed. We do NOT allow furry avatars in our uniforms. 
 
That said, they also contribute to sim traffic. If you find one that is wandering the sim, let them tick up our numbers for a bit before murder.


### Rank Structure

Ranks listed from lowest to highest


#### [Militia] - [Reinforcement / Friends / House Plants]
- No authority.

Members of the militia may be in because they are a furry and applying to join our cult group, a furry seeking to change their ways, someone from another group who likes fighting alongside us, or those who do not have the commitment to join our group in earnest. Members of militia may donate for our gear. Militia is OPEN ENROLLMENT, if they don't do what you tell them to do or mouth off blackscreen them.


#### [Cultist] - [Recruit]
- No authority. Inductees into the group.

A cultist is a recruit that seeks to prove themselves worthy of becoming part of Chaos. They are taught basic information and combat maneuvers, and honed until they can hold their own in the field of battle.

- Authority over cultists and militia.
 
The first enlisted rank in Chaos. The first tier of personnel. Those who have proved themselves to be more than fodder and have been inducted into the group.


#### [Veteran] - [Enlisted]
- Authority over renegades, cultists, and militia. May lead small raids.
 
The second enlisted rank in Chaos. Veterans have either proven their mettle in combat to be given access to more equipment or are on the ledger to be given a leadership position in the future. They may lead supervised raids, and may shadow NCOs and officers to learn to do training.


#### [Marauder] - [NCO]
- Authority over enlisted ranks. Issued orders during small raids, maintains group policy & standards within the general enlisted.

### Specialized Roles
THESE ARE NOT RANKS

#### [Corruptor] - [Trainer]
- Blanket term for all trainers. Authority over training (outside of officers) of their own specific training sessions.
 
Corruptors are both the best friend and obstacle to a cultist joining the group, and to enlisted members continuing their training to Veteran. They are the primary source of knowledge. The corruptor serves as a cultist's only reliable avenue into the group and the only reliable (ha) source of information outside of this handbook. To the enlisted members, corruptors are their guides to learning how to use their gear and help determine whether they are ready for further promotion or not.


#### [Enforcer] - [Internal Affairs Officer]
- Deals with infractions within the group. Actively enforces the will of the Lords & Overlords.
 
Members that have shown themselves to be loyal without fault, and willing to go the extra length to enforce the will and policies of the command staff. This is our Human Resources Department. 


#### [Mechanicus] - [R&D]
Mechanicus is focused on the creations of War-machines. responsible for the creation and maintenance of the tools of the trade. Anyone who has begun contributing to group projects can be made Mechanicus.
